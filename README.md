This is a thesis project for bachelor's degree. The goal of the project is to create a web application for the centralization of donations in Ukraine and to create a system in it that makes it possible to help injured citizens and animals as a result of the war, as well as to optimize the reporting process, which will make it possible to reduce the risk of spending money that is not worth it.
Crowdfunding platforms are websites that provide interaction between fundraisers and the crowd.
Sometimes when government and nonprofit funding is in short supply, getting the help you need can be difficult. This is why crowdfunding can be such a valuable resource. It allows people to connect with their support community in a simple and accessible way.
The main principle of crowdfunding is that people can help each other.

Steps: 
1. After the idea appeared, I decided to select the target audience and conduct a survey. The target audience of the project was divided into several categories: those who want to donate and those who want to collect money.
   
3. Everyone was asked questions as part of the survey, thanks to which it was possible to highlight the main points on which it was possible to start product development. The main criterion of the analysis was the aspect of dividing the audience into Ukrainian and European.

5. The I was using Figma to make simple prototypes and to make a comparison with other web apps.

## Versel doesn't work properly yet
## In order to run a project, please, install in locally :)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
